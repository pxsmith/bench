      .f2.merriweather Summer Challenge
      p.o-40 <a href='https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Canada'>Canada</a> is amazing. The government offers new mothers and fathers paid time off. When our son was born in the States, neither of us had any paid time off. Then, my wife even had to go back to work after seven weeks. Quite the difference here and now. The government does not cover my full pay, so my <a href='https://www.acl.com/about-us/careers/'>amazing employer</a> offers a top-up for 3½ months so I can receive full pay. You read that right &ndash; 3½ months fully paid time off. The Summer Challenge is my attempt to make the most of it. I want to do something new, or interesting, or memorable every. single. day.
