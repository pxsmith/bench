    </header><small></small><p>Last Sunday I saw <em>Rogue One</em> with my wife and three-year-old son. (Starting him out right.) We had plans in the evening, so decided to squeeze in the Sunday matinee. I looked online to make sure there were ticketsâ€”there were. However, by the time we got there, the show sold out. Annd, the tears started flowing from my son. His hopes were set on seeing it opening weekend.</p>
<p>I made the executive decision to risk being late to out other event to be able to see <em>R1</em> opening weekend.</p>
