    p.mb3 Hello! üëã I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;ve made your way here. My name is Phil Smith. I&rsquo;m a product designer in <a href='http://vancouverisawesome.com'>Vancouver, BC</a> working for <a href='http://acl.com'>ACL</a>. I have experience branding, designing mobile and web apps, building prototypes, illustrating, and animating. I love good company, food, beer, music, and the great outdoors. If you want to chat about a side project (or anything else for that matter), let&rsquo;s grab a drink! üçª <a(href='https://twitter.com/philsmithdesign'>DM me on Twitter</a>.
